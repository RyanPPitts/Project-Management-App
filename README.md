# Ruby on Rails

Ruby on Rails is a development framework which gives web developers a structural framework for all the code they write. The Rails framework assist programmers to build websites and apps by abstracting and simplifying most of the repetitive tasks.

Ruby is the programming language which is used alongside Rails. Ruby is to Rails as PHP is to Symfony and Zend, or as Python is to Django. The only appeal of Ruby towards the programmers lies beneath the elegance and concise of the language.

Pros:
Easy to build MVC (Model, Views and Controllers)
Wide variety of 'gems' that can help you execute an web project quickly
Syntax is easy to understand and initutive
Great error and debugging with gems like Better Errors
Large selection of open sourced libraries


Cons: 

Not a great experience for windows users. 
Not a sought after skill in my job market

To initiate your rails app you will need to open your command line and type "rails s" to start the server.

Very similar to bootstrap and was extremely easy to install using the Bulma gem file.    

Here are a couple resources that helped build out the Bulma CSS elements
