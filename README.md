#Which programs were used and why

#Ruby on Rails

#Bulma

Bulma is a free, open source CSS framework based on Flexbox.  Designed for mobile, built with flexbox, modular and free.

Very similar to bootstrap and was easy to integrate with the Bulma rails gem

Syntax was easy to understand and made a lot of sense.  For example if you wanted your button to be bigger you just add the class = "button is-large"

Here are a couple resources that helped build out the Bulma CSS elements
